when one goes against food
he finds that the world is a dark and lonely place
food should be accepted
food should be loved
for without food, we are nothing
we cannot go on
we cannot live
we cannot survive
for hence we came forth into this world, we come with the ideas of food
food has been the essential thought that has preoccupied our minds
like money, it is a mind forged manacle which binds us to the ground
